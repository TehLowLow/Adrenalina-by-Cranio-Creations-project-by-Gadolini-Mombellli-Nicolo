     * standard turn.
     * Then it starts iterating through the players and at every step makes them perform a turn. At the end of
     * every step, the methods for replacing picked up loots and weapons on the map are called. This loop

     * ends and starts the Final Frenzy Mode loop, which iterates one last time through the ArrayList of Players
     * by making them perform their last Final Frenzy turn.
     * After this final loop, the methods for checking the winner are called, and then the match ends.
